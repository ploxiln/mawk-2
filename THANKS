I appreciate the help from:

Arnold Robbins advised me on new features such as length(array) and
changing environment such as strtod() behavior. Most important
he encouraged me to make a new mawk release.  He also introduced
me to Nelson H.F. Beebe.

Nelson tested mawk on about 90 machines. He modernized the code so
it could be compiled with different C and C++ compilers. He did
the autoconf setup so the build could be controlled by configure.
The details are in ChangeLog.beebe.
